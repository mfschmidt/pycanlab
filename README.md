# pycanlab
A partial port of Tor Wager's lab's CanLab matlab code to python

As I have many other demands on my time, this will never be a full port of the code at https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore. It's more like a place for me to put python ports of those specific CanLab functions I need, so I can use them on compute nodes without matlab licenses. If you want to add your own, submit a pull request or contact me; perhaps this can grow into a community resource free of matlab licensing restrictions.

This is done for my own convenience, with gratitude and respect for Tor Wager and Martin Lindquist and their contributions to science. I've learned a lot from both of them without yet having met either of them.

See the following for more:

Even though libraries here are ports, not copies, the GPL license is used here pursuant to its use in the original CanLab code.
